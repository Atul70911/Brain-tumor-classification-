Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN
This project is focused on classifying brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used consists of 7023 human brain MRI images, categorized into four classes: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary Tumor. The model is designed to achieve high accuracy in classifying the tumors, with the aim of reaching 99% accuracy.

Overview
The goal of this project is to classify MRI images of brain tumors into the following categories:

Glioma
Meningioma
No Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
The project utilizes deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, to process MRI scans and accurately classify them.

Dataset
The dataset used for this classification contains MRI images of different sizes. It includes:

7023 MRI images across the four categories.
The No Tumor class is sourced from the Br35H dataset.
Classes:
Glioma Tumor
Meningioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
No Tumor
del Architecture
The classification model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leveraging their strong ability to capture spatial features in images.

Key components:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions to focus on essential patterns.
Fully Connected Layers: Enable classification based on learned features.
Activation Functions: ReLU for non-linearity and softmax for final classification.
Preprocessing
All MRI images are preprocessed to ensure consistency:

Resizing: All images are resized to a fixed resolution suitable for the model input.
Normalization: Pixel values are scaled to fall between 0 and 1.
Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to improve model generalization.
Training
The model is trained using Categorical Cross-Entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer.
Accuracy is the primary evaluation metric.
Early Stopping is used to prevent overfitting.
Batch Size and Epochs are adjustable based on performance during training.
Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using a separate validation dataset.
Confusion Matrix and Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score) are generated to assess performance.
